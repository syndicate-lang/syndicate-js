 - [DONE] `during`
 - [DONE] `let { TimeLaterThan } = activate require("@syndicate-lang/driver-timer");`
 - [DONE] `react`
 - [DONE] `spawn*` or similar - looks like `spawn on start { ... }` will do the trick
 - [DONE] activation
 - [DONE] remove ground dataspace syntax
 - [DONE] `spawn :let childVal = parentCalculation { ... }`
 - [DONE] better autobuilding for smooth and fast dev; babel uses gulp?

 - `defer` statement
 - `define/query`
 - some kind of `stop facet` statement - put a Symbol on the fields blob?

 - dataspaces, relays

 - [DONE? Surely there's more] pin down and fix the problems with facet field scope (!!)

 - `npm init @syndicate`

 - drivers
    - [DONE] timer
    - [DONE] ui
    - [DONE] web
    - alert?

 - alias wrapExternal to index.js

 - @syndicate-lang/standalone, analogous to @babel/standalone
